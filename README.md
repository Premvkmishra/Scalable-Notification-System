## Introduction

The scalable notification system is built using Django, providing a robust platform for handling notifications in real-time. The system integrates with other web app components to notify users about important updates and events. This can be extended to other parts of the application for alerts, messages, and system updates.

## Features

- **Real-time Notifications**: Users receive notifications instantly as events occur.
- **Customizable Notifications**: Define notification types and actions.
- **Database-backed**: Stores notifications in a relational database for persistence.
- **User-specific Notifications**: Notifications are personalized for individual users.
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports multiple languages for global usage.

source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Apply database migrations:


python manage.py migrate
Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface:


python manage.py createsuperuser
Run the development server:


python manage.py runserver
Now, you can access the application at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser.

Usage
Sending Notifications: Notifications can be sent via Django signals, views, or custom management commands. For example, to send a notification when a user performs a specific action, use Django signals or invoke the notification system from a view.

Displaying Notifications: Notifications can be accessed from the frontend by querying the database or using real-time communication mechanisms like Django Channels.

Customization: You can customize the notification types, templates, and how they are displayed in the frontend by modifying the notification system logic and templates.
